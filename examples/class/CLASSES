# A class is a blueprint for creating object
# Classes are declared using the 'class' keyword
# Instances of a class are called 'objects'
# All classes have a built-in __init__() function, which is always
# ...executed when a class is being initiated
# the __init__() function can be used to assign values to object
# ...properties

# The 'self' parameter is similar to the 'this' pointer in C++. It
# ...refers to the current instance of the class. It has to be the
# ...first parameter of any function in the class. It does not have to
# ...named 'self'

#you can delete properties of an object using the 'del' keyword

#For an empty class definition, you must use the 'pass' keyword to avoid getting an error
