In order to run all the test cases from the command line:
# pytest -s test_example1.py

In order to run one specific test case:
# pytest -s test_example1.py -k <test case name>

test_case1 and test_case2 should pass
test_case 3 should fail and show the error

When debugging on VS Code:
The debugger will check all the tests that have been declared. Then,
it will start executing the tests from the first breakpoint.

To view print statements within tests, you must run the test(s) with the -s tag
# pytest test_example1.py -s

Fixtures are a way to provide parameters to tests. They are called when they are passed 
as a parameter to the test function.

The fixture test_case_name is called for all 3 test cases, and uses the os module to print
the name of the test case.

To generate a html file with a summary of the test results:
# pytest --html=<name>.html test_example1.py
