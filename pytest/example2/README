In order to run all the test cases from the command line:
# pytest -s test_example2.py

In order to run one specific test case:
# pytest -s test_example2.py -k <test case name>

test_case1 and test_case2 should pass

When debugging on VS Code:
The debugger will check all the tests that have been declared. Then,
it will start executing the tests from the first breakpoint.

To view print statements within tests, you must run the test(s) with the -s tag
# pytest test_example1.py -s

Fixtures are a way to provide parameters to tests. They are called when they are passed 
as a parameter to the test function.

The fixtures fix_x and fix_y are called for both test cases. They are called when the test cases
are called, and their return values are passed in as parameters.

The fixture setup takes the parameter autouse==True. This means that the setup fixture is automatically
called before every test case.

To generate a html file of test results:
# pip install pytest-html
# pytest --html=<name>.html test_example1.py
